Using 12 months of Nation wide sales data to create a forecast or classification system. 
This is still a work in progress, but I have done some feature extraction on the time series data, and tried both forecasting regression (RF) and a few classification
techniques as well.

I am still trying to find what the most interesting thing to predict would be, perhaps the prediction of what will be a larger purchase,
timing and location wise, so that good marketing materials can find their way to the right customers for discounts etc.
